# Project-SD
Lotery Game


Project is working perfectly so far, just need to be indented, commented, and tested, be aware to
test it change the Math.rando() value in the instatiable class from 1 to 10 or lower 
in order to test it faster.

if you find a bug please let me kno, any imporve that can be make.

Another thing is please change the letter of the for loops for a herarchy order
its a mess example if i used for int i in the first loop change the others letter
for j,k,l,m,n,o,p, for example I use letter U for one looop it doesnt make sense
